# Octo-doom
This repository contains my [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) configuration that I use across devices. For now it's largely similar
to the out-of-box options/configuration for Doom. I hope to trick it out even more and make it more suitable for my needs:
 - note taking
 - organizer
 - LaTeX
 - some modeline configuration 
 
 Cheers!
